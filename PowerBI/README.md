# Power-BI

This section highlights my work with Power BI, emphasizing effective data modeling techniques and the creation of robust, performant DAX measures. 

## Included topics:

-   Dimensional modeling with star schemas
    
-   Fact and dimension table design
    
-   Relationships and cardinality handling
    
-   Time intelligence functions (e.g., YTD, MTD, same period last year)
    
-   DAX pattern library for common business metrics

## Familiar concepts:

-   DAX optimization for large models
    
-   Variables and measure branching techniques
    
-   CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, VALUES, SELECTEDVALUE
    
-   Aggregation logic using SUMX, AVERAGEX, COUNTROWS
    
-   Advanced date tables and disconnected slicers
