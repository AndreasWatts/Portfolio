# Data-Architecture

This section showcases some sample images for data architecture i made. The materials here reflect anonymized versions of real-world projects involving modern data stack components and best practices for pipeline design, orchestration, governance, and performance optimization. While high-level in nature, these examples are chosen for their clarity in illustrating foundational patterns and architectural decisions.

## Included topics:

-   Layered architecture (raw → staging → modeled → reporting)
    
-   Star and snowflake schema design
    
-   Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 1 & 2)
    
-   Orchestration and scheduling patterns
    
-   ELT pipelines using DBT
    
-   Data warehouse modeling (BigQuery, Snowflake, Fabric, Azure)
    
## Familiar concepts:
    
-   Medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
    
-   Data lake vs. data warehouse considerations
    
-   Data quality frameworks (expectations, alerting)
    
-   Version control for SQL and infrastructure-as-code
    
-   Cost optimization in cloud-based storage/compute
    
-   Data governance and role-based access control
