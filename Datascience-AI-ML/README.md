# Datascience-AI-ML

This section features selected examples showcasing my skills in data science, machine learning, and applied AI. The projects here are simplified and anonymized, focusing on explainability, reproducibility, and clarity. They span a range of common business and research problems, illustrating my approach to data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.

## Included topics:

-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    
-   Classification and regression models
    
-   Clustering and dimensionality reduction
    
-   Time series forecasting
    
-   Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
    
-   Pipelines using `scikit-learn` and `XGBoost`
    
-   Visualizations with `matplotlib, Seaborn` and `plotly`
    

## Familiar concepts:
    
-   Model interpretability (SHAP, permutation importance)
    
-   CI/CD for model retraining
    
-   A/B testing for model impact
    
-   Using `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `pyTorch`, and more.
    
-   Working with unstructured data (text, time series)
    
-   Experiment tracking with MLflow and Weights & Biases
